# Creates a new array to return the intersection of the two input arrays
def intersection(array1, array2)
  # Verify neither array is empty or nil

  # Set smaller array as values to compare

  # Instantiate new array for intersection

  # For each element in first array

  # Check against each of second array

  # If find match, push to intersection array

  # Return array of intersection
end


# Nested loop O(n^2) ?


# Second solution is through hash table?
